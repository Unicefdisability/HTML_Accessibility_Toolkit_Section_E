					<span>Dr Omar Abdi, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director, Programmes: </span>
				</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>UNICEF works across more than 190 countries and territories, promoting the rights and wellbeing of every child in everything we do.   UNICEF advocates for and supports governments to create enabling environments and equal opportunities for all children to survive and thrive, including the over 240 million boys and girls with disabilities living in the world today. </span>
			</p>
<p>Our work on disability inclusion is mandated by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and aligned with the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy (UNDIS) and the UNICEF  Strategic Plan. With the 2017 Executive Directive on Accessibility in Programme-Related Construction Activities (CF/EXD/2017-004), UNICEF  reaffirms its commitment to ensure physical accessibility is a principle for all the infrastructure that is built through our programmes, including in humanitarian action. </p>
<p>This toolkit is a result of extensive consultations with UNICEF employees, partners and persons with disabilities.  It’s a set of technical resources that will help our staff to promote and support accessibility and inclusion across our programmes and operations.  </p>
<p>We invite UNICEF colleagues and partners to apply this guidance in their work, to ensure that construction related to our programmes, such as school buildings, health clinics, water and sanitation facilities, are free of environmental barriers.  </p>

			<p>
				<strong>
					<span>Hannan Sulieman, UNICEF Deputy Executive Director, Management: </span>
				</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>UNICEF is committed to promote an accessible and inclusive work environment for every employee and is investing to increase opportunities for persons with disabilities to join our workforce. This Accessibility Toolkit is an important resource to help us deliver on this commitment, respecting and promoting diversity, equity and inclusion in programmes and operations across the organization.  </span>
			</p>
<p><span>In 2014, a staff survey on accessibility of UNICEF programmes and premises revealed that 84 per cent of offices required awareness-raising materials and technical capacity on accessibility.  In a follow-up All-Staff Survey in 2019, only 39 per cent of respondents deemed their office space was physically accessible for persons with disabilities.   </span></p>
<p><span>To address the growing internal demand for resources to improve our office buildings, we established a  Greening and Accessibility Fund, developed guidance to support renovations for environmentally friendly and accessible premises and set up the Environmental Footprint and Accessibility Assessment Tool (EFAAT). </span></p>
<p><span>Data as of 2021 shows us that 52 per cent of UNICEF premises meet “level 1”, the minimum organisational requirements for accessibility. But we can do better, and we must do better.  UNICEF’s Strategic Plan Indicator E2.5 on Percentage of UNICEF offices that are disability inclusive and accessible, sets a target of 100% by 2025.  This is an ambitious target, but for UNICEF’s 100% organizational commitment on disability inclusion, only a target of 100% of accessibility in our premises and operations can be acceptable. </span> </p>

			<p id="id_213">
				<span>This toolkit was developed so the work of UNICEF programmes can support children like nine-year-old Amal, a girl with a physical disability who lives in Zaatari camp and who can now play with other children because the local playground has been made accessible to all. It can support children like Frinpali, a seven- year-old boy who uses a wheelchair and now receives appropriate education in Burkina Faso because his school has been made accessible. This toolkit has been conceived as an instrument to facilitate the dialogue with partners and the involvement of organizations of persons with disabilities (OPDs)  on accessibility-related issues. And it has been developed with UNICEF’s current and future employees with disabilities and other organizations in mind, so that the facilities they work in are made more accessible and inclusive for all.</span>

					<span class="normalized" id="id_288">
						<span>is an international human rights treaty of the United Nations intended to protect the rights and dignity of persons with disabilities. It was adopted on 13 December 2006 and describes human rights frameworks linked to accessibility, aspects of universal design, reasonable accommodation and international standards for accessibility. UNICEF’s existing commitments and policies to promote accessibility are aligned with the CRPD.</span>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p id="id_289">
					<span>The accessibility of spaces and places determines the extent to which everyone – including persons with disabilities, older persons and children – can live, work and learn independently and participate fully and equally in society. Equal access to transportation, media, information and communication technologies, and public services and facilities, such as schools, libraries and town halls, facilitates the participation of persons with disabilities, in both urban and rural communities. Accessibility is also critical in emergency contexts, such as refugee camps, to ensure access to humanitarian services and facilities.</span>
				</p>
				<p id="id_290">
					<span>As of October 2021,184 countries have ratified the CRPD and, increasingly, countries around the world have adopted standards, codes and laws to mandate accessibility, in line with CRPD requirements.</span>
				</p>
				<p id="id_291">
					<span>Accessibility is one of the primary principles of the CRPD, set out in article 3 as a vital precondition for the effective and equal enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights for persons with disabilities, for example to health, education, information and communication. Other CRPD articles related to accessibility are article 9: Accessibility; article 19: Living independently and being included in the community; article 24: Education; and article 30: Participation in cultural life, recreation, leisure and sport.</span>

				<p id="id_293">
					<span class="normalized" id="id_294">
						<span>In the 1980s, the American architect Ron Mace coined the term ‘universal design’, which means good design that benefits everyone. </span>
					</span>
					<a href="#c002" class="footnote" id="noteref_2">2</a>
					<span id="id_295" class="normalized">

				</span>
				<p id="id_296">
					<span>Seven principles underpin the concept of universal design, summarized as follows:</span>
				</p>
				<ul id="id_297">
					<li id="id_298">
						<span>
							<strong id="id_299">Equitable use: </strong> Providing the same means of use for all users, with and without disabilities</span>
					</li>
					<li id="id_300">
						<span>
							<strong id="id_301">Flexibility in use: </strong> Accommodating individual preferences and abilities, such as left- or right-handedness</span>
					</li>
					<li id="id_302">
						<span>
							<strong id="id_303">Simple and intuitive use: </strong> Ensuring easy to understand utilization, including for people with low literacy</span>
					</li>
					<li id="id_304">
						<span>
							<strong id="id_305">Perceivable information: </strong> Communicating key information clearly and in multiple ways</span>
					</li>
					<li id="id_306">
						<span>
							<strong id="id_307">Error tolerance: </strong> Minimizing hazards and adverse consequences of accidental actions</span>
					</li>
					<li id="id_308">
						<span>
							<strong id="id_309">Low physical effort: </strong> Requiring little operating force to use</span>
					</li>
					<li id="id_310">
						<span>
							<strong id="id_311">Size and space: </strong> Providing appropriate space for reach and use, if seated or standing</span>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p id="id_312">
					<span>The outcome of using universal design is that environments, buildings and products are inclusive of, usable by and accessible to everyone, to the greatest possible extent, including children, adults and older persons with and without disabilities, pregnant women, parents with children or using baby strollers, and people carrying heavy equipment, suitcases, groceries, etc.</span>
				</p>
				<p id="id_313">
					<span>The concept of universal design applies to almost every area of life. While this toolkit focuses on the accessibility of infrastructure and spaces, the concept also applies to many other areas, programmes and services, such as mobility (e.g., accessible cars, buses or trains; inclusive bus stations; accessible communication on mobility-related web platforms), communication (e.g., inclusive events, sign language interpretation; meetings or lessons; easy-to-read publications; accessible posters) and information and communication technology (e.g., accessible web services and mobile apps; audiovisual content with captions and transcriptions; accessible files and software).</span>

					<span>The accessibility continuum</span>
				</h2>
				<p id="id_317">
					<span>The accessibility continuum is a concept that describes the experience of children, adults with disabilities and older persons departing from their homes, using pathways, crossing roads and taking transportation to reach, enter and use services and facilities. These facilities can be libraries, public meeting halls, sports fields, health care facilities, courthouses, marketplaces, conference rooms, office buildings, etc. A continuous route means that circulating through it is safe, unrestricted and possible using a wheelchair,  a walking frame or a service dog, with no obstacles or barriers blocking the way. Such a route must be continuous because, like in a chain, if one link is broken, the chain is compromised.</span>
				</p>
				<p id="id_318">
					<span id="id_319" class="normalized">
						<span>Four steps ensure the accessibility continuum: reaching a facility; entering a facility; moving around a facility; and using specific features of a facility. </span>
					</span>
					<a class="footnote" href="#c004" id="noteref_4">4</a>
					<span id="id_320" class="normalized">
						<span>These align with the RECU methodology that stipulates that accessible facilities should be </span>

							<span>easy to reach, enter, circulate and use. </span>
						</span>

					</strong>
				</p>
				<p id="id_323">
					<span>Planning for an accessible environment requires a broad vision of the accessibility continuum perspective. For example, if the route from home to school is accessible for a child who uses crutches but there are stairs at the school entrance and classroom doors are hard to push and pull, the child will have difficulty entering the school or learning and participating in activities with his/her peers.</span>
				</p>
				<p id="id_324">
					<span>Similarly, if a UNICEF staff member using a wheelchair has an adjustable desk, an accessible work space with appropriate doorway sizes and accessible toilets, he/she will be able to work on an equal basis with others. However, if he/she is unable to independently access the building because there is no accessible parking space, drop- off zone or kerb (ramp) to get on the sidewalk, the overall accessibility of the workplace is compromised.</span>
				</p>
				<p id="id_325">
					<span>At least 10 common pitfalls can be avoided or remedied, often at low or no cost, to achieve an accessibility continuum.</span>

				<p id="id_376">
					<span>
						<strong id="id_377">Welcoming, respectful attitudes </strong>– If a school is physically accessible but the teacher has a negative, discriminatory attitude and does not want to teach a child with a disability, unless the teacher’s attitude is changed, the child’s access to education will be limited. Attitudes can be improved through role models, interaction with other teachers and students with disabilities, experiential training or campaigns, and programmes to transform harmful social norms.</span>

					<span>Many of the technical specifications in this toolkit are based on International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards, developed by a committee of experts. In particular, ISO 21542:2011 ‘Building construction – Accessibility and usability of the built environment’ applies to construction and the modification of new and existing buildings and is available to UNICEF staff via the Supply Division.</span>
				</p>
				<p id="id_382">
					<span>Related ISO standards cover accessible lifts (4190-1), emergencies (22320), assistive devices such as tactile walking surface indicators (23599) and graphical symbols for public information and accessibility (7001). Some of the common global symbols used for accessibility are available in the Toolbox.</span>

						<span>For UNICEF programmes, ISO 21542 can be applied to all construction-related activities. While dimensions in the standard are geared primarily towards adults, it also recognizes that people across age levels have different needs, so it incorporates, for example, accessibility in toilets designed for children. In addition, accessibility for children is considered in this toolkit based on other existing guidelines and principles. </span>

				<p id="id_473">
					<span>When addressing an accessibility assessment (in particular for an existing building), it is important to define its overall scope.

			</div>
			<div class="level2" id="id_475">
				<h2 id="d2e948">
					<span>TIP 1: Find out more about the building, facility or school to assess</span>
				</h2>
				<p id="id_476">
					<span>When working with United Nations joint premises, building users and staff, including persons with disabilities, can explain how the building is being used. Staff can help identify existing barriers or concerns, including issues related to building management and security. Some building features are often repeated throughout a building (for example, most have more than one accessible toilet and many doorways to review).</span>
				</p>
				<ul id="id_477">
					<li id="id_478">
						<span>Ask management and/or the school principal how many persons with disabilities are attending the school or working in the facility. If anyone with a disability is using the premises, see if a discussion can be set up with them about areas that could be improved.</span>
					</li>
					<li id="id_479">
						<span id="id_480" class="normalized">
							<span>Ask if any key areas of the building or facility have already been identified that need attention. Request a copy of the building layout/floor plans to assist with the assessment and to prepare the visit, and review the building plans/map, noting locations of potential non-compliance or poor design. Consider printing the map to outline the major areas for review. These documents can also be used to track or highlight potential challenge areas.</span>
						</span>
						<span xmlns:epub="http://www.idpf.org/2007/ops" id="p24" class="page-normal" epub:type="pagebreak" role="doc-pagebreak" aria-label="Page 24">
							<span>24</span>
						</span>
					</li>
					<li id="id_481">
						<span>Ask if an accessibility assessment has ever been conducted in the building; if it has, ask for the date and for any reports or outcomes that can be shared, such as an action plan.</span>
					</li>
					<li id="id_482">
						<span>Ask if accessibility renovations have ever been implemented in the building; if they have, plan to assess them during the site visit. Possibly include a discussion with users of the building to determine if they use the accessibility features and if they are happy with them.</span>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div id="id_483" class="level2">
				<h2 id="d2e964">

				</h2>
				<ul id="id_484">
					<li id="id_485">
						<span>
							<strong id="id_486">Identify relevant accessibility standards or codes</strong> adopted locally (if any) that the building should comply with (for example, a national accessibility code, a building code with accessibility specifications, a universal design for schools by the local ministry of education, etc.).</span>

						<span>
							<strong id="id_494">Form a core group of individuals as part of a task team</strong> to assess accessibility, which includes staff and people with diverse disabilities, architects, engineers, designers, users and managers of the building, etc. Provide the team with key documents and tools, such as the accessibility assessment checklists, to explain the different components, and provide versions in alternative formats if required.</span>
					</li>
					<li id="id_495">
						<span>Ideally, ensure that task teams conducting accessibility assessments include people with diverse disabilities.

				<span>Part 3: Drafting the assessment report and next steps</span>
			</h1>
			<p id="id_568">
				<span>After the site visit is over and all the relevant data and measurements have been collected, an assessment report must be written that summarizes the barriers identified, compares the findings with the applicable standards, and identifies the possible solutions. If the assessment reveals that accessibility renovation work must be planned, an engineer or architect, preferably experienced in accessibility, will be needed.</span>
			</p>
			<p id="id_569">
				<span>Features to be considered will depend on the local context, the types of buildings, the use of the buildings and the users’ characteristics. For example, a school will have more toilets that accommodate children’s size than an office space or town hall/community centre. It is good practice – and in some cultures essential – to have separate boys’ and girls’ accessible toilets. In other contexts, ‘unisex’ accessible toilets can be used by girls and boys, and men and women.</span>
